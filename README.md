Kiddo is a child of self-isolation. DataArt was forced to switch onto remote work mode due to the pandemic outbreak in spring, 2020. That was a challenge to accept, especially for parents, who were supposed to succeed in entertaining their kids. That gave birth to Kiddo, a platform to let parents-engineers make up tasks and teach their kids programming in Python.

Currently, Kiddo is not meant to teach programming from scratch. To solve the simplest tasks you need to learn the basics. However, there are a lot of easy-to-read books for newbies online and any kid can sort out how to solve tasks in Kiddo within a couple of days â€“ on top of that, we are ready to provide hints.

We meant it from the very beginning that anybody should be able to work with Kiddo. Tasks are written in JavaScript and their complexity depends only on how imaginative and vigorous the author is. To create tasks with a graphic field, ready-to-use images sets can be used as well as new ones be created.

Last but not least. We allow building Kiddo into any site that aims at teaching kids Python. You just need to copy the embed code, the same way as you do with YouTube player. If you feel like adding something of your own to Kiddo for it to form an integral part of your site, write to us to kiddo@dataart.com and we will see what can be done.
